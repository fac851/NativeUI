# NativeUI-fac851-2021
NativeUI-fac851-2021v1 adds these fixes:
- Added keypress delay to fix menu selection problems on faster systems (for keyboard and controllers)
- Fixed DropShadow for backwards compatibility
- Subtitle WidthOffset fix

This version of NativeUI is based on Guad/NativeUI (from 14 Jan 2020) which added support for disabling the mouse cursor usage in NativeUI menus completely (by justalemon - Hannele Ruiz, thanks!). The download below includes two versions, so you can choose a NativeUI with mouse enabled or disabled.

Download [**NativeUI-fac851-2021**](http://lucid-q.net/nui/)

Note for widescreen users with GTA V: to display menus and the user interface without cropping you can install [**Flawless Widescreen**](http://www.flawlesswidescreen.org/) with [**this script**](https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1876-grand-theft-auto-v-fov-ultrawide-new-fws-script/).
Select 'Pillarboxing Removal' in Flawless Widescreen. (The mouse cursor is not in the correct position for NativeUI menus in widescreen.)

## Installation
Copy 'NativeUI.dll' into the 'scripts' folder of Grand Theft Auto V
